Welcome to my daily practice repository for solving questions from Striver's SDE (Software Development Engineer) sheet. In this repository, I'll be regularly solving coding problems and documenting my solutions as I work through Striver's SDE sheet. The sheet is a fantastic resource for honing my problem-solving skills and preparing for technical interviews.

## About Striver's SDE Sheet

Striver's SDE sheet is a comprehensive collection of data structures, algorithms, and coding problems designed to help software developers excel in technical interviews. The sheet covers a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

## Repository Structure

- Each day, I'll be adding a new folder.
- Inside each date folder, you'll find the solutions to the problems I solved on that day.
- The solutions will be written in C++ and will include explanations where necessary.

## Progress

I'll be keeping track of my daily progress by updating this README and committing my solutions to the corresponding date folders.

## Contribution

While this repository primarily serves as a personal practice space, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and improvements from the coding community. If you find any issues with my solutions or want to propose better approaches, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.
